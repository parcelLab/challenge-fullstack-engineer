# parcelLab Fullstack Engineer Quest

![header img](./img/5cg1mm.jpg)
Welcome to the lost Fullstack Engineer Repository.
You've probably come a long way - join me around the campfire, make yourself a coffee and take a break - before you start your quest.  
Take your time and read this Markdown parchment carefully, it will help you on your mission to become a Fullstack Engineer at parcelLab.

## Instructions

This repository is separated in both backend and frontend `packages/backend` and `packages/frontend`, 
each one has it own readme.

## Scenario
At parcelLab we integrate with a variety of online retailers and shipping providers. One of the more common tasks for us is to process those different data sources, analyse and combine them and serve them to one our users in a human readable and convenient way.

In this scenario, you are developer at parcelLab and you are tasked with building a website that displays the orders and their tracking status for a specific user. Therefore you will need to build a frontend that presents this data to the user and a backend that serves the data to the frontend.

## Our Expectations
You might be wondering after reading the below scenario, how much effort and time we expect you to invest in this task. We know that you likely have a job, a life, further open job applications and other things that require some of your valuable time. Therefore you should **not** **spend more than** **3-4 hours** on this task. 

Just for you to have a understanding about the scope we expect, here a list for each level you might be applying for:

## What you will need
For setting up the website / frontend you can just set up a standard React/Vue/Svelte... project with the transpiler of your choice or don't use any framework at all. Choose the tool you like. (Hint - we are fans of functional programming and react hooks üòè)

For the backend you can also use a programming language or framework of your choice. At parcelLab we're mostly using Node.js and Python, but ultimately use what you're most comfortable with. 

If you're done with this challenge, simply send us a link to a repository that we can access - or create a PR to this repository. 

## In the end you should have
- [x]  a website (frontend)
    - [x]  that has 3 views
        - [x]  email address input form
        - [X]  order history view
        - [x]  order detail view
    - [x]  that fetches data from your backend API
    - [x]  that upon entering a known email address of a user will present you with the order history related to that email address and allows you to view order details
- [x]  an API (backend)
    - [x]  that parses and processes the provided CSV files' content
    - [x]  that serves content to the frontend via created endpoint(s) in a format of your choice

## What really makes us happy üòç
- [x]  You provide us with a README.md that explains how we can run your app
- [x]  Your code is well structured, clean and readable
- [x]  You add comments and documentation, if your code isn't self-explanatory

- [x]  You use automated tests where appropriate

## That is it - everything else is up to you! Happy coding!
